# City Generation

## (Working Prototype)

![Prototype Screenshot with basic cubes](readme_images/Prototype_Screenshot.png)

This generates a city grid that creates sections that split up into there on the neighborhood. The way I programmed it, somewhat works off the Binary Space Partitioning (BSP for short). Creating a section and dividing it over and over to get a city block, while it's doing that it storing information of the locations where to add the prefabs.
