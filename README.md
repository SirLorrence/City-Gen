# City Generation

## (Working Prototype)

This generates a city grid that creates sections that split up into there on the neighborhood. The way I programmed it, somewhat works off the Binary Space Partitioning (BSP for short). Creating a section and dividing it over and over to get a city block, while it's doing that it storing information of the locations where to add the prefabs.

## What I Learned so far

- Using list to split grids into sections can easily be done, but I believe there is a easier way this can be done
- I need to learn how to use binary trees
